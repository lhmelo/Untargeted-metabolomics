# camera function --------------------------
# This function processes an xcmsSet object using CAMERA to look for 
# other ions that could arise from the same mass feature. Input is an
# xcmsSet object (xset) and the ionization mode as "positive" or "negative".
# Input is:
#       1. a grouped xcmsSet object (xset)
#       2. the ionization mode as "Epos", "Eneg", "Apos", or "Aneg" (Mode)
#       3. the resolution in ppm to be used for matching adducts
#       and isotopes (PPM); defaults to 15
#       4. Since CAMERA looks at the correlation of chromatograms between ions
#       as part of how it determines which ions are, in fact, adducts or isotopes,
#       the p value cutoff required. True adducts and ions should correlate 
#       quite well in the raw data, so the default is 0.0001. (PVal)
# Output is a named list containing:
#       1. the CAMERA object (root part of the name is whatever the input 
#       xcmsSet object was called, suffix is .xsa)
#       2. a data.frame of the output from CAMERA (.annot). There will be one row for
#       every ion in the original data after the reference ions were removed. 
#       Columns:
#             a. the mass feature name (MassFeature), 
#             b. the m/z (mz), 
#             c. the retention time in minutes (RT), 
#             d. any isotopes CAMERA thinks it has found (isotopes), 
#             e. any adducts it thinks it has found (adduct), and 
#             f. the pseudospectrum group (pcgroup). "Pseudospectra" are the 
#             chromatograms that CAMERA hypothesizes could be related, i.e. they
#             follow the same pattern in intensity. Pseudospectra do not necessarily
#             have m/z that would actually make them the same compound, though, so
#             think of grouping the ions into pseudospectra as simply the first 
#             step in making a hypothesis about which ions might be related. 
#       3. a data.frame (suffix is .otherions) where each row is an ion that had 
#       at least one other potentially related ion, so >= 1 other isotope or 
#       adduct. The columns are:
#             a. MassFeature, 
#             b. mz, 
#             c. RT, 
#             d. pseudospectrum group (pcgroup), 
#             e. the type of ion CAMERA thinks this ion might be (IonType), 
#             f. the possible charge of the ion (Charge), 
#             g. the m/z of the other, potentially related ion (MassOfM), 
#             h. and a group number where other ions with the same number
#             are potentially isotopes of this one (IsoGroup). 


# Nota bene: The xcmsSet object must have already had the group() function
# applied to it or this will not work. That's something inherent in the 
# CAMERA package, not something I implemented. The problem with that is that
# you then have to run this on your ENTIRE dataset, which will be time 
# consuming and RAM intensive if you've got very many samples. You can
# always subset your xcmsSet object to contain only a handful of samples, but
# then you have to redo the xcms::group() function and then, once you've
# run that function, you'll have to figure out which ions correspond to which
# in the full dataset.   - Laura
