# CAMERA post-processing function --------------------------
# This function processes a CAMERA generated peak table (*.annot) and organizes neutral mass and isotope information.  
# Input is:
#       1. a CAMERA object (xsa; most likely xsaFA)
#       2. a data.frame of the output from CAMERA (.annot). There will be one row for
#       every ion in the original data 
#       Columns:
#             a. the mass feature name (MassFeature), 
#             b. the m/z (mz), 
#             c. the retention time in minutes (RT), 
#             d. any isotopes CAMERA thinks it has found (isotopes), 
#             e. any adducts it thinks it has found (adduct), and 
#             f. the pseudospectrum group (pcgroup). "Pseudospectra" are the 
#             chromatograms that CAMERA hypothesizes could be related, i.e. they
#             follow the same pattern in intensity. Pseudospectra do not necessarily
#             have m/z that would actually make them the same compound, though, so
#             think of grouping the ions into pseudospectra as simply the first 
#             step in making a hypothesis about which ions might be related. 
# Output is a named list containing:
#       1. the same CAMERA object used as input (root part of the name is whatever the input 
#       xcmsSet object was called, suffix is .xsa)
#       2. a data.frame of the output from CAMERA (.annot). 
#       3. a data.frame (suffix is .otherions) where each row is an ion that had 
#       at least one other potentially related ion, so >= 1 other isotope or 
#       adduct. The columns are:
#             a. MassFeature, 
#             b. mz, 
#             c. RT, 
#             d. pseudospectrum group (pcgroup), 
#             e. the type of ion CAMERA thinks this ion might be (IonType), 
#             f. the possible charge of the ion (Charge), 
#             g. the m/z of the other, potentially related ion (MassOfM), 
#             h. and a group number where other ions with the same number
#             are potentially isotopes of this one (IsoGroup).
