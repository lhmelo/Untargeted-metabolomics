#This function processes an xcmsSet object using CAMERA to identify mass features which are related to one another as adducts or isotopomers.
#
#Input:
#1. a processed xset object from xcmsfunction.  Should be called xset3.
#
#Output:
#1. A list (CAMERAlist) containing [[1]] a processed peak list containing information about adducts, isotopes and neutral masses (xset.annot) and [[2]], a CAMERA object (xsaFA).

#Mode is "positive" or "negative". Default is positive

setwd(outputpath)

camera <- function(xset, Polarity ="positive", PPM = 5) {

library(CAMERA)
library(snow)

xsa <- xsAnnotate(xset)

xsaF <- groupFWHM(xsa, perfwhm = 0.6)

# peak group verification with peakshape correlation (groupCorr); slow step----

xsaC <- groupCorr(xsaF)

#annotation of possible isotopes (findIsotopes)----
xsaFI <- findIsotopes(xsaC, ppm = PPM)

#annotation of adducts and calculating hypothetical masses for the group; very slow step---- 
#use xsaFA object to visualize EICs

xsaFA <- findAdducts(xsaFI, ppm = PPM, polarity = Polarity)

# Make a table of the annotated peaks-------
xset.annot <- getPeaklist(xsaFA)

CAMERAlist <- list(xset.annot, xsaFA)
